Master Page in DotNet Core refer to pages that reflect Layout of the application
This page will have the Header, Footer etc components that are common throughout the application
I will connect my Home, About etc Pages with this Layout Page so that I don't have to repeat it again and again.
Layout View provides consistent view for all the components
