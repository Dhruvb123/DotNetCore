Views provide UI to the applicatio of the user.
A view is used to display contents of an application to a user and take user i/p from the user.
View uses model data to Create UI
View contains bot C# and HTML markup code that runs on web server

** We have Razor view engine in DotNet that converts the C# code to HTML as Browser only understands HTML.
Razor Engine is used as the default view engine in MVC Framework.
Razor isn't a language, but provides template markup syntax to segregate HTML markup and programming code in a view.

• While creating a Razor view, you should
consider following rules:
• Start inline expressions with @
• Enclose code blocks between @{and}
• Variables are declared with the var keyword
• Enclose strings in quotation marks
